## üîß Two Approaches to Data Retrieval

### 1. Web Scraping (Default)
- **How it works**: Directly extracts data from website HTML
- **Pros**: No API keys required, can access all public data
- **Cons**: Sites may block requests, structure changes break scrapers
- **Best for**: When API access is not available

### 2. API Method (Conceptual)
- **How it works**: Uses official e-commerce APIs when available
- **Pros**: More reliable, faster, less likely to break
- **Cons**: Requires API keys, limited availability for Indian e-commerce
- **Best for**: When API credentials are available

**Note**: Most Indian e-commerce platforms don't have publicly available APIs for price comparison. The API method is included as a conceptual implementation for future use.
